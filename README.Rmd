# scorecal

The goal of scorecal is to capture my personal best practices for credit score calibration.
This package will be develoiped over time
and I intend to produce blog posts to record the development.

## Installation

You can install scorecal from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rgayler/scorecal")
```
